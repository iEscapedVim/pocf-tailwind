## **Code of Conduct for Pakistan Orphan Care Forum (POCF)**
The POCF Code of Conduct establishes, upholds, and promotes humanitarian principles and values that all members are expected to follow in their work. This Code of Conduct (CoC) defines the core principles that guide members' actions and commitments and is signed by all members. By signing this code, members pledge to ensure their conduct aligns with these principles in all aspects of their work.<br /><br />
Humanitarian principles are fundamental for establishing and maintaining access to vulnerable populations, whether in the context of natural disasters, armed conflicts, or complex emergencies.
A key foundation for POCF members is to respect and advocate for beneficiaries' right to give and receive humanitarian assistance while protecting their privacy and dignity and adhering to ethical and legal standards.

#### **Core Principles**

##### **Humanity**
Human suffering must be addressed wherever it exists. The aim of humanitarian action is to protect life, safeguard health, and ensure respect for human dignity.
##### **Neutrality**
Humanitarian actors must remain impartial in hostilities and avoid engaging in political, racial, religious, or ideological controversies. Aid must not be used to promote any political or religious agenda. Assistance will be provided solely based on need.
##### **Impartiality**
Humanitarian efforts must prioritize the most urgent cases of distress without discrimination based on nationality, race, gender, religion, class, or political opinions.
##### **Empowerment**
Humanitarian action must prioritize empowering individuals and communities to actively participate in decisions that affect their lives, ensuring their voices are heard and their capacities strengthened.
POCF and its members are committed to promoting self-reliance and resilience among beneficiaries, avoiding actions that undermine their autonomy. Members will neither knowingly nor negligently allow themselves or their employees to be used for purposes that compromise beneficiaries' empowerment or align with political, economic, military, or other external agendas.
##### **Accountability**
POCF members are accountable to beneficiaries. Members will ensure beneficiary participation throughout all stages of the project cycle and will strive to include marginalised and vulnerable groups in decision-making processes. Two-way communication strategies will be implemented to improve service delivery and ensure stakeholders' voices are heard.
By adhering to this Code of Conduct, POCF members demonstrate their commitment to fostering trust, transparency, and respect while upholding the highest humanitarian standards.
